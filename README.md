# My CapStone

This app was built with all the knowlege i gained through Bottage.
I made this social media app for my capstone for Bottage Course for anyone that would likes to do vlogs, blogs.
This was really challenging for me but was really fun to build. At this moment this app only allows you to make a user create, edit, and delete blogs. visit other users profiles.
